Here are the notes summarizing the implementation of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using the NLTK library in Python:

1. Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or sentences. This step is essential for breaking down the text into manageable pieces.

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "NLP is quite fascinating"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```
- Library: `nltk.tokenize`
- Function: `word_tokenize()`
- Output: `['NLP', 'is', 'quite', 'fascinating']`

2. Stemming
Stemming reduces words to their base or root form. It is useful for text normalization.

from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

stemmer = PorterStemmer()
words = ['eating', 'eats', 'ate']
wordss = ["running", "ran", "runs"]
stems = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]
print(stems)
```
- Library: `nltk.stem`
- Stemmer: `PorterStemmer()`
- Function: `stem()`
- Output: `['eat', 'eat', 'ate']`

3. Lemmatization
Lemmatization is similar to stemming but more accurate as it reduces words to their base form using a dictionary.

from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
nltk.download('wordnet')

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
words = ['eating', 'eats', 'ate']
lemmas = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos='v') for word in words]
print(lemmas)
```
- Library: `nltk.stem`
- Lemmatizer: `WordNetLemmatizer()`
- Function: `lemmatize()`
- Output: `['eat', 'eat', 'eat']`

4. Stop Words
Stop words are common words (like "is", "and", "the") that are often removed from text before processing, as they carry less meaningful information.

from nltk.corpus import stopwords
nltk.download('stopwords')

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
# print(stop_words)
filtered_text = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]
print(filtered_text)
```
- Library: `nltk.corpus`
- Function: `stopwords.words('english')`
- Output: `['NLP', 'quite', 'fascinating']`

These steps provide a foundational understanding of preprocessing text data in NLP tasks, including breaking down text into tokens, normalizing words through stemming and lemmatization, and filtering out non-essential words.
