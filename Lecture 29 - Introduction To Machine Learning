Introduction to Machine Learning

What is AI?
Definition: AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.
Alternate Definition: It is the ability of a computer to think and learn.

Key Terms in AI:
Learning: The ability of an AI system to improve its performance based on experience.
Reasoning: The process of drawing logical conclusions from available information.
Self-Correction: The ability of an AI system to automatically correct its errors.

Types of AI:
1. Weak AI (Narrow AI): AI systems that are designed and trained for a specific task.
2. Strong AI (General AI): AI systems with generalized human cognitive abilities, capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do.

What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Definition: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses statistical methods to enable machines to improve their performance with the amount of training data fed to them.
Analogy: 
  Human Learning: Observations --> Learning --> Skills
  Machine Learning: Data --> Model/Predictor --> Predictions

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning:
   Description: Uses labeled data to train the model.
   Process: Labeled Data & Labels --> Machine --> ML Model --> Predictions --> Test Data

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   Description: Uses unlabeled data and identifies patterns within the data.
   Process: Data --> Model --> Groups/Clusters
   Clustering: Grouping similar instances based on patterns in the data.

Examples:
1. Supervised Learning: Email spam classification, cat-dog classification.
2. Unsupervised Learning: Cat-dog clustering.
3. Both Supervised and Unsupervised: Recommendation systems, playing the AlphaGo game.

Evolution of AI, ML, and Deep Learning:
Artificial Intelligence (1950s-1980s): Techniques enabling computers to mimic human behavior.
Machine Learning (1980s-2010s): AI techniques that give computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Deep Learning (2010s onwards): A subset of ML making the computation of multi-layer neural networks feasible.

What is Data Science?
Definition: Data Science is a field of study that uses statistical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.
Sources of Data: Databases, business transactions, sensors, and more.
Techniques Used: Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
